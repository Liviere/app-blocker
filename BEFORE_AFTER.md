# Single Instance Feature - Before & After

## Problem: Multiple Instances Causing Malfunctions

### Before Implementation ❌

**Scenario 1: Multiple GUI Instances**
```
User Action: Double-clicks app-blocker-gui.exe twice
Result: 
  ❌ Two GUI windows open
  ❌ Both try to manage the same config.json
  ❌ Conflicts when saving settings
  ❌ Monitoring state becomes inconsistent
  ❌ Application malfunctions
```

**Scenario 2: Multiple Monitor Instances**
```
User Action: Starts monitoring twice (GUI + manual)
Result:
  ❌ Two monitor processes running
  ❌ Both tracking the same apps
  ❌ Double counting of usage time
  ❌ Apps killed prematurely
  ❌ Usage log becomes corrupted
```

### After Implementation ✅

**Scenario 1: Multiple GUI Instances**
```
User Action: Double-clicks app-blocker-gui.exe twice

First Instance:
  ✅ Launches successfully
  ✅ Shows main window
  ✅ Ready to use

Second Instance:
  ✅ Detects existing instance
  ✅ Shows friendly warning dialog:
      ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
      │ App Blocker Already Running         │
      ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
      │                                     │
      │ App Blocker is already running.     │
      │                                     │
      │ Only one instance of the           │
      │ application can run at a time.     │
      │ Check your system tray or          │
      │ taskbar for the existing instance. │
      │                                     │
      │              [  OK  ]               │
      └─────────────────────────────────────┘
  ✅ Exits gracefully
  ✅ First instance continues working
```

**Scenario 2: Multiple Monitor Instances**
```
User Action: Starts monitoring twice

First Instance:
  ✅ Launches successfully
  ✅ Begins monitoring apps
  ✅ Tracking usage correctly

Second Instance:
  ✅ Detects existing instance
  ✅ Prints clear error message:
      "App Blocker monitoring is already running. 
       Only one instance allowed."
  ✅ Exits with code 1
  ✅ First instance continues monitoring
```

**Scenario 3: GUI + Monitor Running Together**
```
User Action: Opens GUI and starts monitoring

GUI Instance:
  ✅ Acquires GUI lock (AppBlocker_GUI)
  ✅ Shows main window
  ✅ Working normally

Monitor Instance:
  ✅ Acquires Monitor lock (AppBlocker_Monitor)
  ✅ Begins monitoring
  ✅ Working normally

Result:
  ✅ Both run concurrently without conflict
  ✅ Separate locks prevent duplicate instances
  ✅ Normal operation as designed
```

## Technical Comparison

### Before
```python
# gui.py - Before
def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = AppBlockerGUI(root)
    root.mainloop()
    # ❌ No instance checking
    # ❌ Multiple instances possible
```

### After
```python
# gui.py - After
def main():
    # ✅ Check for existing instance
    single_instance_lock = ensure_single_instance("AppBlocker_GUI")
    if single_instance_lock is None:
        # ✅ Show user-friendly warning
        messagebox.showwarning(
            "App Blocker Already Running",
            "Only one instance can run at a time."
        )
        sys.exit(1)
    
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = AppBlockerGUI(root, single_instance_lock)
    root.mainloop()
    
    # ✅ Clean up lock on exit
    single_instance_lock.release()
```

## User Impact

### Benefits ✅
1. **Prevents Data Corruption:** Only one instance modifies config files
2. **Accurate Tracking:** Single monitor process ensures correct usage counting
3. **Better UX:** Clear feedback when attempting multiple launches
4. **System Stability:** No resource conflicts from duplicate processes
5. **Tray Awareness:** Message directs users to check system tray

### Edge Cases Handled ✅
1. **Crash Recovery:** Lock automatically released on crash
2. **Normal Exit:** Lock explicitly released in finally block
3. **System Tray:** Works correctly with minimized instances
4. **Autostart:** Doesn't interfere with Windows startup
5. **Multiple Users:** Each user session has independent locks
